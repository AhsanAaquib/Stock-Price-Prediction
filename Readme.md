# Stock Price Prediction

This project implements a machine learning model to predict stock prices using historical data. It leverages Python, popular data science libraries, and Streamlit for interactive visualization.

## Features

- Data preprocessing and feature engineering
- Model training and evaluation (e.g., Linear Regression, LSTM)
- Interactive dashboard for predictions
- Visualization of historical and predicted prices

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Stock-Price-Prediction.git
    cd Stock-Price-Prediction
    ```
2. Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

1. Prepare your stock data in CSV format.
2. Run the Streamlit app:
